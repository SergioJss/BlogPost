Today's Lesson




What I have learned today was about Commands and how to use them. We've
learned the basics and wrote them down to get used to them in MacOS and Linux.

pwd - Where I am
ls - more on folders (ls -all to show everything on an empty folder)
Clear - Clear the command prompt
cd - Change Directory (either go back or go inside a folder
echo - Write on files
cat - See what we wroe on the files
rm/rm -rf - Delete files and/or force removal of folders
mkdir - create a directory/folder
touch - create a file
mv - move or change the name of a folder/file
nano - write or change moreinside of a file
man - know the uses and capabilities of a command

I really like the challenges of having to memorize a lot of commands and knowing
the usages of every one of them. This can definitively help me to understand and
optimize my usage and practice on different OS's at the moment of troubleshooting as an IT technician


SIDE NOTE: become better at memorizing Commands and making them work. Don't
be afraid of playing but CAREFUL WITH DELETING


October 16:

We've learned how to add more things to our pages using bootstrap,and we could make it a challenge for other things that we are supposed to learn

class too quick. I didn't like it.



October 17:
We finished our challenge to make a bigger page with different specs. It was better cuz we didn't do the Mindfulness thing, so I was awake all the time.


Side note: I have to finish it before monday. Also do the other two things. Frick my life
